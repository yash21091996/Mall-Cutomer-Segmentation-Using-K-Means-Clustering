# Mall-Cutomer-Segmentation-Using-K-Means-Clustering
**Motivation**

Market segmentation can help you to define and better understand your target audiences and ideal customers. If you're a marketer, this allows you to identify the right market for your products and then target your marketing more effectively.

Using Machine Learning algorithms makes it easy to segment your customers according to their behaviours. This can be done by just collecting basic data for example customer's annual income, their purchase history etc. Usually mall owners issue a card to customers which is used to track their purchase history.

**Dataset**

The dataset is aquired from kaggle and the link is given below :

The dataset consists of following five features of 200 customers:

1. CustomerID: Unique ID assigned to the customer

2. Gender: Gender of the customer

3. Age: Age of the customer

4. Annual Income (k$): Annual Income of the customer

5. Spending Score (1-100): Score assigned by the mall based on customer behavior and spending nature.

**Results derived from Visualizations:**

1. The data has nearly gaussian distribution.
2. Customers with low annual income have relatively low spending scores.
3. Customers with fair enough income spend the most.
4. Females spending score is more than males but the difference is not too significant.
5. People of smaller ages spend less.
6. Average age of cutomers is between 30 to 40 years.
